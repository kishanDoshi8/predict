# Design System: Verdict

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "Friendly Matchday Ledger"**

Verdict’s interface behaves like a fast, trustworthy score desk for friend-group competition. It keeps social energy visible, but it never sacrifices legibility or game-rule clarity for spectacle. The visual rhythm is compact, direct, and state-explicit, so players can make decisions quickly and verify outcomes without friction.

The voice is calm precision with competitive energy: sharp information hierarchy, disciplined color semantics, and interaction states that always declare intent. Primary color appears as signal, not decoration. Surfaces stay neutral so scoring cues, rank cues, and outcome cues remain cognitively immediate.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Compact spacing and explicit state signaling over decorative layout density.
- Monospace-forward typography for scoreboarding clarity and numerical stability.
- Restrained base surfaces with high-contrast competitive accents.
- Interaction-first depth: motion and elevation only when state changes.

## 2. Colors

The palette is a restrained product system where neutral architecture carries reading comfort and the rose/orange pair carries competition energy.

### Primary

- **Live Signal Rose** (oklch(0.645 0.246 16.439)): Reserved for primary actions, active competitive status, and high-priority game calls where immediate attention is required.

### Secondary

- **Ember Accent Orange** (oklch(0.769 0.188 70.08)): Used for supporting emphasis, hot-state cues, and secondary action highlighting where urgency is directional, not critical.

### Tertiary

- **Rank Gold** (oklch(0.828 0.189 84.429)): Used only for podium/rank semantics and celebratory position indicators.

### Neutral

- **Paper Background** (oklch(1 0 0)): Main reading surface and form/copy background.
- **Night Surface** (oklch(0.21 0.006 285.885)): Dark-mode raised container and dialog/card body.
- **Strong Ink** (oklch(0.129 0.042 264.695)): Default body text and high-contrast UI labels.
- **Muted Ink** (oklch(0.554 0.046 257.417)): Secondary metadata and explanatory copy.
- **Subtle Border** (oklch(0.929 0.013 255.508)): Input, card, and divider boundary definition.

### Named Rules

**The Signal Scarcity Rule.** Primary and accent are signaling tools, not atmosphere paint. If everything is loud, nothing is readable.

**The Outcome Color Rule.** Win/loss colors communicate game state only. They never stand in for neutral UI semantics.

## 3. Typography

**Display Font:** Fira Code Variable (fallback: ui-monospace, monospace)
**Body Font:** Fira Code Variable (fallback: ui-monospace, monospace)
**Label/Mono Font:** Fira Code Variable

**Character:** Technical and compact, with stable glyph rhythm for numbers, scores, and leaderboard data.

### Hierarchy

- **Display** (700, 2rem, 1.2): Hero-equivalent page titles and high-priority room/prediction headers.
- **Headline** (600, 1.5rem, 1.3): Section-leading headings and panel titles.
- **Title** (600, 1.125rem, 1.35): Card titles, dialog headings, and dense list headers.
- **Body** (400, 0.875rem, 1.5): Main copy and most UI text; prose blocks should remain within 65-75ch when used.
- **Label** (500, 0.75rem, 1.3, 0.01em): Status tags, auxiliary labels, and compact metadata.

### Named Rules

**The Numeric Stability Rule.** Any score, payout, streak, or rank value uses title/body weights that favor readability over stylistic contrast.

**The One-Family Rule.** Use one type family with weight shifts, not mixed display/body families, to keep high-density UI coherent.

## 4. Elevation

Verdict is flat by default. Elevation appears only when interaction state changes (hover, active tab, modal open) or when focus needs explicit affordance.

### Shadow Vocabulary

- **Micro Lift** (shadow-xs, equivalent to 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)): Inputs and outline controls at rest where subtle affordance is needed.
- **Interactive Lift** (shadow-sm, equivalent to 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)): Active segmented controls and selected tab triggers.
- **Modal Lift** (shadow-lg, equivalent to 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.18)): Dialog surfaces over scrim.

### Named Rules

**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** No persistent decorative depth on passive surfaces.

**The State-Driven Depth Rule.** Shadow exists to confirm interaction state, not to stylize containers.

## 5. Components

All core components are compact, tactile, and state-explicit.

### Buttons

- **Shape:** Rounded medium rectangle (0.5rem radius).
- **Primary:** Live Signal Rose fill with inverse ink text; compact horizontal padding (0.5rem 1rem).
- **Hover / Focus:** Hover darkens fill; focus uses ring with 3px visible treatment.
- **Outline / Secondary / Ghost:** Outline uses neutral boundary on transparent/paper surfaces; ghost relies on muted/hover surface swap rather than border noise.

### Chips

- **Style:** Full-pill shape with compact x-padding and very small y-padding.
- **State:** Success badges use low-alpha win background + win text + thin semantic border.

### Cards / Containers

- **Corner Style:** 0.625rem default card/dialog corner language.
- **Background:** Neutral paper in light mode, night surface in dark mode.
- **Shadow Strategy:** Flat at rest; modal-level elevation only when context isolation is needed.
- **Border:** Subtle neutral border token.
- **Internal Padding:** Defaults to 1rem-1.5rem based on context density.

### Inputs / Fields

- **Style:** Transparent field body on bordered container with compact height (2.25rem).
- **Focus:** Explicit ring + border color shift to ring token.
- **Error / Disabled:** Invalid state uses destructive border/ring semantics; disabled state drops opacity and pointer affordance.

### Navigation

- **Tabs:** Compact segmented control with active-state background and state-explicit text color promotion.
- **Active indicator:** In line-variant tabs, active marker is rendered via pseudo-element underline/edge rail, not extra decorative chrome.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** keep primary/accent usage intentional and tied to action or competitive status.
- **Do** preserve compact control heights and spacing for high-frequency interaction flows.
- **Do** keep focus-visible rings explicit (3px ring treatment) on all interactive primitives.
- **Do** use win/loss/rank tokens only for game semantics and leaderboard interpretation.

### Don't:

- **Don't** resemble casino or gambling dark-pattern products.
- **Don't** resemble noisy, overloaded gamer interfaces where visual aggression overwhelms clarity and task flow.
- **Don't** use side-stripe borders (border-left or border-right accents above 1px) as decorative emphasis.
- **Don't** use gradient text or decorative glassmorphism as default UI treatments.
- **Don't** ship inconsistent button/input/tab vocabulary across screens; consistency is part of trust.
